"Kurt Donald Cobain was an American musician who was the co-founder, lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Nirvana."
"Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream rock."
"Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene that later became known as grunge."
"Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been misinterpreted by the public."
"In addition to Smells Like Teen Spirit, Cobain wrote many other hit songs for Nirvana, including Come as You Are, Lithium, In Bloom, Something in the Way, Heart-Shaped Box, All Apologies, About a Girl, Aneurysm, and You Know You're Right."
