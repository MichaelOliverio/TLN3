"Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist and film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation."

"His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls and bridges throughout the world."
"Banksy's work grew out of the Bristol underground scene, which involved collaborations between artists and musicians."
"Banksy says that he was inspired by 3D, a graffiti artist and founding member of the musical group Massive Attack."
"Banksy displays his art on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and self-built physical prop pieces."
"Banksy no longer sells photographs or reproductions of his street graffiti, but his public installations are regularly resold, often even by removing the wall they were painted on."
"Much of his work can be classified as temporary art."
"A small number of Banksy's works are officially, non-publicly, sold through an agency created by Banksy named Pest Control."

"Banksy's name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation."
"In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, Banksy is described as white, 28, scruffy casualâ€”jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring."
"He looks like a cross between Jimmy Nail and Mike Skinner of The Streets."
"Banksy began as an artist at the age of 14, was expelled from school, and served time in prison for petty crime."
