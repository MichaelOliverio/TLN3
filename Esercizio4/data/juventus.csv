"Juventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari." 
"It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later."
"The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship."
"Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese."
"In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I."
"Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground."
"There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juventus out of Turin."
"Alfred Dick, the club's president,was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War."
"This helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1."
"The club established itself as a major force in Italian football since the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base,which led it to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo's era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup champions, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others."
